Additional Notes
------------------------------------------------------------

- All notebooks contain preprocessing steps, training pipelines,
  and evaluation procedures — no extra setup steps required.
- Model files are included only for architectures used in final evaluation.
- Dataset is not included due to size; it can be accessed from:
    • Mendeley: Eye Diseases Dataset https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/s9bfhswzjb/1
    • Kaggle alternative source https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhinav099802/eye-disease-image-dataset
